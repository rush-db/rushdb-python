class RecordsAPI(BaseAPI):
    """API client for managing records in RushDB.

    The RecordsAPI provides a comprehensive interface for performing CRUD operations
    on records within a RushDB database. It supports creating, reading, updating,
    and deleting records, as well as managing relationships between records and
    importing data from various formats.

    This class handles:
    - Individual and batch record creation
    - Record updates (full replacement and partial updates)
    - Record deletion by ID or search criteria
    - Record searching and querying
    - Relationship management (attach/detach operations)
    - Data import from CSV format
    - Transaction support for all operations

    The API supports flexible input formats for record identification, accepting
    record IDs, record dictionaries, or Record objects interchangeably in most methods.

    Attributes:
        client: The underlying RushDB client instance for making HTTP requests.

    Example:
        >>> from rushdb import RushDB
        >>> client = RushDB(api_key="your_api_key")
        >>> records_api = client.records
        >>>
        >>> # Create a new record
        >>> user = records_api.create("User", {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"})
        >>>
        >>> # Search for records
        >>> from rushdb.models.search_query import SearchQuery
        >>> query = SearchQuery(where={"name": "John"})
        >>> results, total = records_api.find(query)
